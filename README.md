# Color Extraction Android Task

## Background

As part of this task, weâ€™d like you to build an app that:
1.	Downloads an image from a given URL
2.	Extracts the main colours from the image
3.	Displays the image with the colours as per the Figma designs

## UI

Weâ€™d like you to:
1.	Build the UI so that it matches the Figma specification
2.	Verify that the UI looks correct across different form factors

## UX

When a user navigates through the images, we want them to see the image even
if the colours havenâ€™t been extracted, so that they are not looking at a blank
screen.

Images should be viewable in the same order they appear in the list, unless, of
course, there is no image for a given URL.

## Downloading Images

We have included [LargeImageDownloader](app/src/main/java/com/popsa/colorextraction/LargeImageDownloader.kt)
for downloading images, as well as a list of [imageUrls](app/src/main/java/com/popsa/colorextraction/ImageUrls.kt)

The images provided by Picsum are quite small, so we are scaling them to produce larger images for this task.

## Colour Extraction

For the colour extraction, weâ€™d like you to use androidx.palette.graphics.Palette;
however, it could be swapped out at a later stage for a different library. Please
design your solution with this possibility in mind.

The main colours we want to extract are:
* Vibrant: which can be mapped from Paletteâ€™s VibrantColor
* Light Vibrant: which can be mapped from Paletteâ€™s LightVibrantColor
* Dark Vibrant: which can be mapped from Paletteâ€™s DarkVibrantColor
* Muted: which can be mapped from Paletteâ€™s MutedColor
* Light Muted: which can be mapped from Paletteâ€™s LightMutedColor
